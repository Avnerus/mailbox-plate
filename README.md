# mailbox-plate
## Design and 3D Print your own mailbox plate using open source software.
 1. Create a vector design using Inkscape (or Adobe Illustrator) in the desired width and height of the plate.
 2. Use the sample OpenSCAD file to make the engraved plate. Dimenions in sample:
  -   180mm x 39mm x 3mm.
  -   1mm engraving.
 3. Export to STL and 3D print.
 4. Spray-paint the plate to the desired color of the engraving.
 5. Use a mini paint roller to paint over the background (press only slightly so that the letters do not get painted).
 6. Done! Glue it to the mailbox.
